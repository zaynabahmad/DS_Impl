# 1.Stack Data Structure

##### This is a simple implementation of the stack data structure in C language using linked list. The project consists of four files: stack.h, stack.c, main.c, and Makefile.

### Requirements
##### To compile and run the project, you need a C compiler installed on your system, such as gcc.

### Compiling the Project
##### To compile the project, run the following command in your terminal:
> make
>
This will generate an executable file called stack in the same directory.

### Running the Project
##### To run the project, simply execute the following command:
> ./stack
>
This will run the main function in main.c and test the stack implementation.

### Modifying the Code
##### If you want to modify the code, you can edit the source files stack.h, stack.c, and main.c. After modifying the code, you can recompile the project by running the make command again.
