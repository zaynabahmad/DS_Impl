# 1.Stack Data Structure

##### This is a simple implementation of the stack data structure in C language using linked list. The project consists of five files: stack.h, stack.c, main.c, Matching_paranteses and Makefile.

### Requirements
##### To compile and run the project, you need a C compiler installed on your system, such as gcc.

### Compiling the Project
##### To compile the project, run the following command in your terminal:
> make
>
This will generate an executable file called stack in the same directory.

### Running the Project
##### To run the project, simply execute the following command:
> ./stack
>
This will run the main function in main.c and test the stack implementation.

### Modifying the Code
##### If you want to modify the code, you can edit the source files stack.h, Matching_paranteses.c and main.c. After modifying the code, you can recompile the project by running the make command again.
